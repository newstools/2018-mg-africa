It was during this meeting in 2014, Nene told the commission, that Ajay Gupta attempted to extract information from him. His testimony contradicted an earlier statement he made in an interview with eNCA’s Siphamandla Goge in 2016 where he denied having “an engagement” with the family. The Sunday Times reported that Nene had also not disclosed his meetings with the Gupta brothers to President Cyril Ramaphosa when he was re-appointed as finance minister in February this year. In a letter delivered to the office of the ANC chief whip, Nene said he was “indebted to the ANC and the people of South Africa” and thanked the party for his opportunity to serve the country as an elective representative. Following his testimony, Nene apologised to the nation and asked to be relieved of his duties. He was replaced by former Reserve Bank governor Tito Mboweni.
