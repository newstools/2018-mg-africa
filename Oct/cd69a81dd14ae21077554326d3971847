In her artist statement she says: “This body of work emerged as both response to and vehicle for the exploration of that dark, vast, complex, spiritual and emotional landscape… Instead of exposing me, as art often does its creator, these collage-paintings acted as curtains behind which I could hide and wait in a period of blindness.” Details: Until November 8 at Everard Read CIRCA, 3 Portswood Road, V&A Waterfront, Cape Town.
