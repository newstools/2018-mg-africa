Irish fire chiefs have advised people to “do the #Neymar” if their Halloween costume catches fire, tweeting a video of the Brazil forward rolling around on the turf. Alongside various safety warnings about bonfires on their Twitter feed, the Dublin Fire Brigade opted for a GIF of Neymar to get their message across. “STOP, DROP & ROLL. If you find yourself in a position where your costume or clothes catch fire, do the #Neymar.
Running will only fan the flames and help the fire spread. STOPPING, DROPPING & ROLLING will smother the flames.” Neymar, who plays for Paris Saint-Germain, is recognised as one of the world’s top players but has an unwanted reputation for play-acting. At the World Cup in Russia he was mocked for his on-field theatrics as Brazil crashed out at the quarter-final stage. © Agence France-Presse
