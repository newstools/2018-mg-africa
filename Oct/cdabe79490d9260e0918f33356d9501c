Intruders (2018) by Mohale Mashigo (Picador Africa)  In Intruders, a collection of short stories that follows author Mohale Mashigo’s bestselling novel The Yearning, she starts things off with an all-important preamble, titled Afrofuturism: Ayashis’ Amateki. In it, she sets out her unease about the term Afrofuturism and its relevance (read: fit) in the African context, when it was coined for black people living in places where they are in the minority. She recognises the differences and uniqueness of each colonised society and how that uniqueness, in the African-American sense, has produced a mode of expression now named Afrofuturism.
