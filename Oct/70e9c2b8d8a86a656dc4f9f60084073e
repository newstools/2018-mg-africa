In an article titled Move over, here comes Tito in the Mail & Guardian, erroneous claims were made about the Macroeconomic Research Group (MERG) and its supposed advocacy of nationalisation. MERG was the detailed macroeconomic and social policy framework prepared for but then unceremoniously rejected by the ANC leadership in 1993. These claims were linked to a more general point attributed to Business Unity South Africa president Sipho Pityana about how the new finance minister, Tito Mboweni, would allegedly be eschewing redistributive economic policy alternatives that privileged a central role for the state (in contrast, we presume, to a primary role identified for the market).
