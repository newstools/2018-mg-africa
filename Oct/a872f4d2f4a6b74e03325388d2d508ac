Kaizer Chiefs coach Giovanni Solinas and star player Khama Billiat have scooped the PSL coach and player gongs respectively for September. The official recognition is just reward for a month that saw their fortunes whip around 180 degrees. Amakhosi won all three of their league matches – against AmaZulu, Free State Stars and Cape Town City – and now sit third in the log, two points off of top spot. Their recovery is quite remarkable considering Solinas was still searching for his first win at the helm when the side travelled to the Mother City at the beginning of the month. Khama Billiat, who signed from Sundowns in the off-season, has been key to that run which has seen his attack bang in eight and the defence concede only one. Throughout the season, Solinas has not hesitated to persistently label Billiat as the best player in the country and is sure to acknowledge him with a bow whenever he comes off the pitch during a game. Upon receiving his award on Monday, the Italian continued his high praise for his Zimbabwean playmaker while also crediting the rest of the team for his achievement. “Football is about teamwork. <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div>The credit for my award must go to my players and to my club,” he said. “Without my players there is nothing.” Billiat, who has three goals and three assists so far this season, said Solinas treats all players at Chiefs equally and they love him for it. “I’m grateful that I have a coach like him,” he said. “I don’t see it as something special, he’s always like that. I’m grateful for the love that he has for me and I love him too, just like everyone. I love the relationship that I have with him.”
