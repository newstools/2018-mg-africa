Reacting to the recent release of discouraging crime statistics, Police Minister Bheki Cele said the police alone cannot win the fight against crime. He appealed for more civilian involvement. But how can people play an active part in the prevention of crime when they become targets? During apartheid, the police were seen as an extension, and agents, of the regime.
After the 1994 democratic dispensation, citizens were expected to accept and smile at the police, which was difficult because they still bore the stigma of apartheid. As a way of improving relations between the police and the people, the government introduced community police forums (CPFs). <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div>It was envisaged that these would drastically help to achieve a crime-free society. To some extent it worked, although the continued reports of police brutality and the involvement of senior police officers in corruption has not helped to inspire public confidence. Also the clip of Mido Macia being dragged behind a police vehicle in Daveyton refuses to leave our minds. The Victims of Crime Survey for 2015-2016, released by Statistics South Africa, shows that South Africans are generally reluctant to report crime, and largely believe the police cannot solve matters. True or false, the status quo of relations between the police and citizens is worrying. In Limpopo, the department of community safety has introduced a programme called Young Civilians on Patrol (YCOP). Through the municipalities, it identifies unemployed people between the ages of 18 and 35, who are trained by the police in basic crime prevention. Upon completion of their training, they join the police on patrols. The idea is that they know where drugs and liquor are being sold without licences. They also know who is dealing with stolen property. But it is sad that some corrupt police officers are telling the criminals who masterminded their arrests, thereby putting the lives of CPF and YCOP members at risk. And, instead of citizens embracing these peace officers, they are labelling them as police informers. The same goes for CPF members. The truth is that criminals are known to the locals and police rely on evidence to effect arrests and ensure that suspects end up in jail. During a campaign aimed at discouraging mob justice — killings — Cele said citizens should apprehend criminals without harming them and call the police. But, despite such calls, mob beatings continue and any requests by either the CPF or YCOP members not to harm crime suspects fall on deaf ears. Yes, the police alone cannot win the fight against crime, but how do we expect people to take an active part when their safety and anonymity are not guaranteed? A lot still needs to be done to improve relations between police and citizens before people can be expected to take an active part in the fight against crime. Otherwise, they will continue to harbour criminals and burn police vans when suspects are being arrested. We need to defuse the tension.
