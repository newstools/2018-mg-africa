THE READING LIST Snakes, Spells, Cadillacs and Kruger Millions: The weaving of story in oral accounts of the extraordinary career of Khotso Sethuntsa by Felicity Wood (2004): A friend sent me this JStor PDF because I didn’t believe him when he told me that apartheid prime ministers HF Verwoerd and JG Strijdom used consult an inyanga in Lusikisiki in the 1940s, not just nje but for reasons related to gaining and maintaining political power. It seems there is truth to this, according to Wood’s writing.The fantastical world of millionaire healer and story spinner Khotso Sethuntsa is daringly told by Wood, who rummages through many texts on narrative, Cape Nguni cosmology, archival news reports from papers such as the Daily Dispatch and, of course, oral accounts of who this man was and what his relationship to Afrikaner elite, mythology and apartheid was.This is a fascinating read.
