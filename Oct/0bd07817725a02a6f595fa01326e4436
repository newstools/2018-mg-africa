Some leaders of the SA Transport Allied Workers Union used Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma’s ANC presidential campaign to get a bribe of R1.5-million to facilitate a depost of R1-billion from state-owned company Prasa to VBS Mutual Bank.

Nathaniel Booysen and Sophia Schalk, a homeless couple, “just knew” they wanted to get married a day after they met a decade ago. EFF leader Floyd Shivambu’s brother Brian, former president Jacob Zuma and Public Investment Corporation boss Dan Matjila have been implicated in a forensic report on the failure of VBS Mutual Bank, released on Wednesday.
