Having never been on the other side of the money counter, it is safe to assume that putting together a festival has its fair share of headaches. There are the various relationships to maintain, high numbers of complimentary tickets dolled out in expectation for some kind of return and elements that exist only to undermine the production. From the outside, it may have seemed like the Joy of Jazz Festival 2018 was very relaxed about late accreditation processes, in the knowledge that these would only widen its coverage.
Certainly, mine and Hugh Mdlalose’s mission for the 20th edition of the festival started out on this note, with open communication between ourselves and the Khanya PR public relations team we were engaging with. On the day of collecting the accreditation, we were informed that the envelope containing Mdlalose’s bands couldn’t be found, this occurred after the accreditation had apparently been cleared. <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div> This was how we found ourselves outside the Sandton Convention Centre for close to an hour with the number we had been given to call when we arrived at the gate going unanswered. Trying different options, we were eventually helped by a man named Neo, also employed by Khanya PR. It halfway helped, in the sense that Mdlalose was given a day ticket. After covering day two, day three would invariably involve more of the same wheeling and dealing. Egos were put aside for the time being, for the sake of what we were there to do. Entering the Sandton Convention Centre via the Conga Stage, we moved into a food hall, where an unbilled band was providing background ambience to a hall full of people more focused on their food than anything else. I imagined this to be the group fronted by vocalist Ncamisa Nqana. With no seating room, I took some seats by the Conga stage to catch the tail end of Tlale Makhene’s ensemble. As the band wrapped up their set which doubtlessly featured lots of interesting interplay between drummer Sphelelo Mazibuko and Makhene — most of which I missed — the master of ceremonies drew our attention to an artist who had been painting on a canvas. The artwork, apparently inspired by the music, turned out to be a portrait of the bandleader, I think, in the middle of a Standard Bank logo. Standard Bank, a long-time sponsor of the event, had apparently become one with the music. A quick smoke break outside led to an encounter with heavy-handed security personnel. What followed was another 15 minutes of haggling as they now demanded tags, not only the wristbands we were equipped with. They didn’t let us go, as such, but turned their attention back to the door, thereby allowing us to slip past. Soon, the Conga Stage was taken by Wazimbo and Banda Kakana, a marrabenta outfit featuring Yolanda Chicane on vocals. From the duet they performed, the elder Wazimbo and the younger Yolanda had an easy chemistry. Chicane, who handled much of the set on her own, has a voice that soared high above the often varying tempos of the music, often recalling London singer Gabrielle in her phrasing. Letta Mbulu’s set, taking place in the vast Mbira Stage was pure nostalgia, with hits such as Jikijela, I Need Your Love and Not Yet Uhuru causing sections of the audience to erupt in unison. It hardly seemed to matter that a substantial part of the singing was carried by the likes of Faith Kekana and Khululiwe Sithole. The lighting was, for the most part, unflattering, with Mbulu covered in bright, ghostly glare. She seemed to be the undisputed drawcard, more a treasured national symbol than the singer of yore. The person I had been looking forward to seeing that night was Philadelphia-born singer Bilal. A sonic traveller with little regard for the inanities of genre, his modus operandi is to segue from one song to the next, not dissimilar to how a DJ would mix tracks. Bilal held his own, even though everything else seemed to be working against him. Emptied of Mbulu’s fans Bilal played to an echoey Mbira Stage, almost dwarfed by the expanses of space. If you were training for a view, you’d have noticed that the visual display screens were out of sync. Before Bilal, at the Diphala Stage, one had watched Joey DeFrancesco, an organist and composer, who moved between the blues, jazz and funk with blistering speed backed by a tight band that included Troy Roberts on the saxophone, Michael Ode on drums and Dan Wilson on guitar. Aesthetically, the Diphala Stage had an austerity to it that centred the music but generally lacked in intimacy. While the large halls work for acts such as Letta Mbulu, for less popular acts like Kengo Nakamura and Carl Fredrik Orrje, it can feel like one is enjoying them from a basement parking lot, concentrating in the face of non-commital audiences. At close to R1 500 a ticket for what is essentially a two-day event, I’d only be willing to pay for something better produced, from a staging point of view. Still, despite the detracting factors, the music seems to translate for the people who flood the festival every year. Friday night’s last show, (the ensemble led by McCoy Mrubata and Paul Hamner) featured running commentary — at least from the corner I was seated in — from a woman moved to tears by the music, and I presume other spirits. She was particularly affected by trumpeter Sakhile Simani’s poise, his subtle solos with a wide emotional register. More inhibited than she was, I could only agree silently that, “JA, no, uyafutha uSakhile Simani.” As for Saturday, my enthusiasm was thwarted, yet again, by the inconsistent treatment, we received. Calling to secure accreditation for the final night, Mdlalose was told that his entry into the festival could not be guaranteed. Out went my enthusiasm and in went my Day 3 wristband into Mdlalose’s pocket. The photos you see here are a testament to his dedication, despite flighty PR operatives who seem to think we are in this for the freebies and perks. I hope the images capture the elegance and transcendence of this music we call jazz. Hopefully through looking at them, you can empathise with the selflessness of those who have chosen to document the music and the obstacles they overcome in the process.
