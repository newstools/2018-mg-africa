As Somalia commemorated the anniversary of a deadly 2017 blast which left at least 500 people dead and scores more injured, a man convicted for his involvement in the attack was executed. As hundreds gathered in the capital of Mogadishu to remember the lives lost, Hassan Adan Isak was executed by a firing squad – by court order –  for driving one of the vehicles that was used in the attack in October 2017. A truck carrying explosives blew up at a busy intersection, tearing through a busy commercial junction of Mogadishu in what has been described as the deadliest bomb attack to hit the country. A year later and there has been no claim of responsibility for the explosion but Islamist militant group Al-Shabab is still believed to have been behind of the attack. Al-Shabab carries out regular bombings across Somalia and especially in the capital in its bid to overthrow the government. The group also controls major towns and rural areas across Somalia where it launches attacks on military, government and civilian targets, as well as terrorist raids in neighbouring Kenya. A memorial tower has been erected in the middle of the intersection in the capital and government has renamed the junction in honour of those who died in the explosion.
