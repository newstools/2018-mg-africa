A growing financial crisis and governance failures at local and provincial government levels have been identified as a “serious fiscal risk” by the treasury in the medium-term budget policy statement (MTBPS). Unpaid bills and accruals are piling up and these costs, which are not reflected in the budget, could have detrimental effects on service delivery if money for this has to be spent on outstanding bills. Provincial departments have an estimated R25-billion in unpaid bills, plus provincial health departments have contingent liabilities of R80-billion from medical legal claims. In 2017-2018, R1.5-billion was paid out for these and this figure is expected to exceed R2-billion in 2018-2019. The situation at municipal level is getting worse.
