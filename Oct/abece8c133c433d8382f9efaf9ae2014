Heather Peterson (46) left her washing machine running when she went to collect the report card of a 10-year-old relative at the Westbury Primary School last Thursday, according to residents familiar with the details of the day. On her way back from the school, in an alley just metres from her home and down the road from the Rahima Moosa Mother and Child Hospital, Peterson and the child were caught in the crossfire of feuding gang members. A photograph of Peterson, lying face down in a pool of her own blood, has been circulated widely among the residents of Westbury, on the edge of Sophiatown in Johannesburg.
