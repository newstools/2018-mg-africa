It has been five months since Meghan Duchess of Sussex and Prince Harry The Duke of Sussex made their vows at the Windsor Castle for the whole world to see. Early this week, the official Twitter account for the royals announced that: “Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are very pleased to announce that The Duchess of Sussex is expecting a baby in the Spring of 2019.” The news of their child, who is referred to as Baby Sussex for the time being, comes a few months after The Duke of Cambridge Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge, Catherine, had their third child, Prince Louis. Their child, who will be Her Majesty the Queen’s eighth grandchild, will be seventh in line to the British throne. Seeing that royals are easily recognised without their last names, many people do not know that the family members go by different surnames in circumstance that require them such as school. <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div> Technically, the official surname for Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Phillip’s descendants is Mountbatten-Windsor. However Prince William and Prince Harry went by William Wales and Harry Wales when they served in the military because they are the sons of the Prince of Wales.  In the same way, Prince Harry’s son Prince George is known as George Cambridge at school. This means that Baby Sussex is likely to have a different surname than the rest of their family; either Mountbatten-Windsor or Sussex.
