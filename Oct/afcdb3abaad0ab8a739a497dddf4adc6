As the Legal Practice Act is about to come into effect, a new advocates’ association is being formed, which its founders say will be “unapologetically black and women-oriented”. The Legal Practice Act has been in the works for over 10 years and, in earlier iterations, has been the subject of fierce resistance from both the advocates, and the attorneys, professions — mostly because it initially sought to do away with the division between advocates and attorneys.
