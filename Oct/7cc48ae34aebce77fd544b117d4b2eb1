Transnet has suspended Edward Thomas — its group general manager of finance — pending an investigation into Thomas’s alleged involvement in alleged misconduct involving contracts. Thomas had previously served as the group supply chain officer. The state-owned rail, port and pipeline company announced his suspension in a statement on Wednesday. Thomas’s suspension follows Transnet’s investigation into allegations of impropriety with advisers and consultants which include Regiments Capital, Trillian Advisory Services, Trillian Capital Partners and Nkonki Inc. According to the statement, Thomas has been suspended pending investigations of misconduct involving numerous contracts. Thomas was informed of the company’s intention to suspend him on October 25. Transnet considered his representation as to why he should not be suspended, and found he did not provide sufficient reasons as to why he should not be placed on suspension. This is yet another high-profile suspension at Transnet this year.
Transnet board chairperson Popo Molefe had warned in August that a “long list” of employees could be suspended or find themselves facing criminal charges, with the possibility of recouping funds looted from the parastatal. This week, Transnet announced that it would continue with the disciplinary action against its group treasurer Phetolo Ramosebudi who has since resigned. Ramosebudi had resigned after Transnet issued him with an intent to suspend him following an investigation into the company’s procurement of 1 064 locomotives in 2014. Regiments Capital and Trillian had acted as transaction advisers at the time.
