Kaizer Chiefs’ Italian coach Giovanni Solinas admitted Sunday that watching his side squeeze into the Premier Soccer League quarter-finals “took two years off my life”. Desperate for a trophy after three barren seasons, Chiefs edged Black Leopards 4-2 on penalties after a 1-1 draw following extra-time at Soccer City stadium in Soweto. Phathutshedzo Nange gave outsiders Leopards a shock 34th-minute lead with a scorching shot from just inside the box. Hendrick Ekstein levelled on 63 minutes, adding the finishing touch to a superb long pass from veteran Bernard Parker. Solinas, who spent most of his coaching career in Algeria before joining Chiefs for the 2018/2019 season, admits there is huge pressure on him to deliver silverware. After being semi-finals losers in a knockout competition, Chiefs have three more chances to break the drought this season — the League Cup, the FA Cup and the Premiership. “The shootout was so emotional and stressful that it took two years off my life,” the Italian said.
“We lacked six key players and that made our task difficult. Among those ruled out by injuries was Zimbabwe striker Khama Billiat, who Solinas believes is the best footballer in South Africa. “We did not play well in the first half, but I saw a different Kaizer Chiefs team after the break — one that performed very well,” added the coach. After matching Chiefs for 120 minutes, Leopards were let down by weak spot-kicks from John Munganga and Mthokozisi Nene that Namibian goalkeeper Virgil Vries comfortably saved. The other round-of-16 tie was also decided by penalties with SuperSport United edging hosts Polokwane City 6-5 after a 1-1 draw. <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div>Thuso Phala scored after 76 minutes for SuperSport. Edgar Manaka nodded a stoppage-time equaliser and after 30 uneventful minutes of extra time, Polokwane team-mate Ayanda Nkili blazed a penalty over the bar to eliminate his side. Title-holders Wits, former African champions Mamelodi Sundowns and Orlando Pirates, Baroka and Maritzburg United qualified for the quarter-finals Saturday.
