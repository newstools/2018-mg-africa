Banyana Banyana has won the 2018 Cosafa Women’s Championship crown after defeating Cameroon at the Wolfson Stadium in Port Elizabeth. South Africa claimed their fifth title with a  2-1  victory on Saturday. Midfielder Refiloe Jane scored the opener for Desiree Ellis’ charges just before half-time. However, Cameroon’s Edith Ngo Mbeleck equalised in the 66th minute. It wasn’t over for the reigning champions, as Jane completed a brace in stoppage time to seal victory for South Africa. Banyana Banyana has won all their five matches — defeated Madagascar 2-1, beat Botswana 1-0, walloped Malawi 6-0, brushed aside Uganda 2-0 and now defeating Cameroon in a thrilling final.
