Outgoing Cosatu second deputy president Zingiswa Losi has been nominated unopposed for the position of president, making her the first woman leader of the federation. Losi was nominated unopposed by delegates at Cosatu’s 13th national congress taking place in Midrand this week. Her unopposed nomination follows months of speculation that affiliated unions would turn their backs on outgoing president Sdumo Dlamini. Dlamini’s relationship with Cosatu has been strained since last year when he defied the organisation’s decision to distance itself from former president Jacob Zuma and call for him to step down. Losi is expected to be officially announced as Cosatu’s new president on Thursday, together with other elected leaders. General secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali will remain in his position along with current deputy general secretary Solly Phetoe. The National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union’s Mike Shingange is expected to take over from outgoing first deputy president Tyotyo James, while Losi’s former position will likely be filled by South African Commercial, Catering and Allied Workers Union’s Louise Thipe.
