Western Cape MEC for economic opportunities Alan Winde has been announced as the Democratic Alliance’s candidate for premier in the province. DA leader Mmusi Maimane made the announcement on Wednesday in Cape Town, dubbing Winde the “jobs premier”. “Whilst we were spoiled for choice in picking candidates … I think without doubt it would be fair to say to you that I’m introducing the jobs premier of South Africa,” Maimane said. Maimane cited Winde’s success in making unemployment in the Western Cape 14% below the national unemployment rate. Winde was competing against provincial leader Bonginkosi Madikizela and DA MP David Maynier for the post.
Madikizela took himself out of the running for mayor to contest for the premiership job. But Maimane said that the ambitious provincial leader has “pledged support” to Winde. Winde will succeed Helen Zille for the post if his party is successfully elected in 2019. More to Follow.
