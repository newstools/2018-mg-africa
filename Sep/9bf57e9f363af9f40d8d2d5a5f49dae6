In some areas of the country, an incorrect version of page 8 was printed, robbing our loyal readers of one of our lead stories this week. You can read the story online here. To make it up to you, anyone with that edition of the paper will receive a one-month free subscription to the M&G.
Because if it’s not right, it’s not good enough. To make amends, we would like to offer you a free month-long subscription to Africa’s Best Read. Please click here and use the promo code MG1MONTHFREE.
