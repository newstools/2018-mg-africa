I was six years old when I first started dancing. But some people in my extended family said that, if I do ballet, I am going to turn gay or end up poor because it is such a hard career. They didn’t want to support it but my mom said: “If it’s God’s plan for your life, one day you’re going to do it.” When I was 10, I ended up going to a really good school and the teacher there said I should do ballet.
But I had told myself, like everybody else, that ballet was for girls. They convinced me [to dance] and I agreed, but didn’t want anyone to know. <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #efefef; } .nws-ad-img { width: 50%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 50%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 120%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div>But after a week, the whole school knew. It was hard for people to accept,which was hard for me. Older guys in my street and at school would bully me a lot. They’d call me over, like: “Come here neguinho [little nigger]. Is it true you do ballet?” I’d say: “Yes”, but very shyly. There is a joke in Brazil where people would say: “This Coke is turning into Fanta”,because, you know, you’re changing from one thing to another. It would make me very upsetbut in my mind I said: “When I become a star, these guys are going to see.” I don’t blame them, really, because doing ballet — especially for men — is not really part of our culture. Brazil is all about football. But when I started attending the ballet school at Theatro Municipal, Brazil’s oldest and most famous ballet school, people started to change; they started to respect me. Even those older boys who used to bully me would come up to me, pat me on the shoulder and be like: “This neguinho is good. He is really, really good.” For me, that was amazing. —
