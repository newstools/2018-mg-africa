Trade union Solidarity, which represents white workers predominantly, is embarking on industrial action at Sasol’s giant fuel plants at Secunda and Sasolburg, which supply most of the fuel needs of the country’s industrial heartland. At any one time, experts say, there is only two weeks’ supply of fuel available in Gauteng and other inland provinces, but Solidarity aims to make Sasol feel the pain without these areas running out of fuel. The two operations supply most of the fuel in Gauteng, the northern Free State, North West, Limpopo and Mpumalanga. Gauteng accounts for 60% of the national fuel demand, consuming 15-billion litres a year. On a regular day, Secunda produces the equivalent of 150 000 barrels of crude oil, which is refined to produce petrol, diesel and various forms of petrochemicals.
