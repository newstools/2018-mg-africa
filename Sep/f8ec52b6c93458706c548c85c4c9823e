Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane has “declined” to run as the party’s candidate for Western Cape premier after dissent arose from within the party. The party’s federal executive met on Tuesday to discuss who would be premier candidate and who would replace Cape Town mayor Patricia De Lille when she leaves office at the end of October. DA spokesperson Solly Malatsi said that Maimane had told the federal executive he would not step in as the candidate for Western Cape premier. “The federal leader, Mmusi Maimane, informed FedEx that he has decided to decline the request for him to stand as the DA’s candidate for Premier of the Western Cape.
This was a request that required careful consideration and consultation with the relevant party structures which made the initial request to him,” Malatsi said on Tuesday. The party has still not decided on who its candidate for Western Cape premier will be, but DA MP David Maynier, provincial leader Bonginkosi Madikizela and MEC for economic opportunities Alan Winde are contending for the post. Meanwhile, DA veteran Dan Plato will return as mayor of Cape Town when De Lille steps aside. Plato, who is MEC for community safety and served as mayor from 2009 to 2011, is now the Cape’s mayor elect.

FedEx warmly congratulate Mr Plato on his nomination, pledge to him our full support, and wish him every success in the task ahead,” Malatsi said. The federal executive will continue to meet on Tuesday to decide on the party’s candidate for premier. An announcement will be made on Wednesday, Malatsi said.
