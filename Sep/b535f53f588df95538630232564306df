Transnet’s board has suspended two senior executives. The state entity issued a statement on Thursday evening, indicating that Thamsanqa Jiyane, the chief officer of advanced manufacturing of Transnet Engineering and Lindiwe Mdletshe the senior manager of strategic sourcing for Transnet Freight Rail have been suspended. The employees are implicated in “multiple investigations” commissioned by the Transnet Board, particularly the awarding of the 1 064 Locomotives Acquisition tender, which escalated to more than R54-billion, Transnet said.
