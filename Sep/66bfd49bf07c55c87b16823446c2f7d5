At the heart of Fordsburg in Johannesburg is Dragon City, where traders source many of their products. On a Tuesday morning, customers are making their way to stock up at Atchar King, where Ashiq Khan and his two business partners have been operating for three months. “We make about R2 000 to R3 000 during quiet days but, when people get paid and pensioners get money, we make, let’s say, between R10 000 and R20 000,” says Khan, who used to run a grocery store in Lenasia South seven years ago. “My business was groceries and snacks but I realised atchar was doing so well that I decided to focus just on it alone,” he says. Atchar can be enjoyed with curry, vetkoek, which is also called magwinya, or the uniquely South African bunny chow called kota. The spicy condiment is made of raw mango, mixed with garlic, oil and spices such as paprika, chilli, barbeque and Portuguese spice, to enhance the flavour.
