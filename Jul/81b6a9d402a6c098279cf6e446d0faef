Mining company Sibanye has made news recently for all the wrong reasons — 21 fatalities in eight incidents at three of its mines this year. Its safety record is of major concern to its employees and management, as well as the government, and has potential implications for the whole platinum mining sector as Sibanye’s proposed buyout of Lonmin is widely seen as the only way to rescue the flailing mining company. If Sibanye manages to buy Lonmin, which it hopes to do by the end of the year, Sibanye will become the second largest platinum producer in the world, with 38 909 permanent employees, compared with its rival Anglo American Platinum’s (Amplats) 25 320. The largest platinum employer is Impala Platinum with 52 012 employees. Sibanye says it has completed its investigations into the causes of the fatalities and is now waiting for the department of mineral resources to release its findings.
