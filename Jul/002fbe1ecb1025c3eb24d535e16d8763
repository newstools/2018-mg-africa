A new group of ANC members have gone to court in a bid to interdict the party’s KwaZulu-Natal provincial elective congress from taking places. Three members of the provincial task team (PTT) appointed to run the conference have confirmed the bid to halt the meeting by members of the Moses Mabhida regions. At this stage the identity of the applicants is not known but two PTT members said they were not the same applicants who had secured an interdict last month stopping the conference from being held. “Those comrades had their issues dealt with last week and are happy to have the conference sit,” one said. “This is another group who have done this for whatever reason. These are people who don’t want the ANC to move forward.” The conference was to have elected a leadership to replace the provincial executive committee which was voted in at the November 2015 conference. That conference was declared unlawful by the Pietermaritzburg High Court last September. Last week the ANC national dispute resolution committee met with the disaffected branches who then gave the go-ahead for conference to sit. A second PTT member said the province was opposing the application after receiving notice of the interdict. ANC PTT convener Mike Mabuyakhulu and coordinator Sihle Zikalala have not responded to call from Mail & Guardian.
