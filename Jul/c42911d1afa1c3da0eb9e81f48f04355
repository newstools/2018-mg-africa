Joao Jan Rodrigues, the 80-year-old former security branch police sergeant accused of being involved in the murder of anti-apartheid activist, Ahmed Timol was granted R2 000 bail on Monday. Rodrigues appeared in the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court on charges of murder and defeating the ends of justice. The state did not oppose bail. The matter was postponed to September 18 for a pre-trial conference at the Gauteng high court in Johannesburg. Almost 47 years since his death, the high court in Pretoria last year found that Timol, just as his family had always maintained, died at the hands of apartheid security branch police while in detention. Judge Billy Mothle found that Timol did not meet his death because he committed suicide but that he “died as a result of having being pushed to fall, an act which was committed by members of the security branch with dolus eventualis as a form of intent, and prima facie amounting to murder”. — News24
