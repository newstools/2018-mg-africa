Kenyan intellectual Patrick Lumumba has said that without land, there can be no peace in Africa. “Nelson Mandela would have reminded us that the last colonial question is land. If you don’t tackle the issue of land‚ you shall never know peace.” Lumumba delivered the Nelson Mandela memorial lecture at Walter Sisulu University Mthatha campus on Tuesday night. Since the ANC’s decision to expropriate land without compensation during its December 2017 national conference — followed by a parliamentary motion to explore the issue in February — constitutional amendment hearings have been taking place across the country.
The hearings are on whether or not Section 25 of the Constitution, which deals with property rights, should be amended. According to Lumumba, former president Nelson Mandela would have questioned why a mineral rich continent such as Africa would have remained poor. “He would have asked how is it that our continent that is so endowed produces what it does not consume and consumes what it does not produce. He would have asked whether the continent of Africa is really liberated. Nelson Mandela would have reminded us that we Africans have suffered more‚” Lumumba said. Timeslive also reported that Mandela, according to Lumumba, would have wanted the continent to “cleanse itself” and “deal with corruption.” “The time has come. We must do away with dealers and have leaders‚ do away with cheaters and have teachers instead. He would have posed the question that: how is it that corruption is still a scourge in our continent? Madiba would have told us to unite.” The lecture was attended by Bhisho legislature deputy speaker Mlibo Qoboshiyane‚ rural development and agrarian reform MEC Xolile Nqatha and ANC provincial secretary Lulama Ngcukaitobi.
