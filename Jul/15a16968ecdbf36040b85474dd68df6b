Eskom’s head of security resigned with immediate effect on Tuesday morning. Eskom spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe said in a WhatsApp message to Fin24 on Tuesday that retired Brigadier-General Tebogo Rakau had stepped down. He said the power utility was not at liberty to disclose employer-employee contractual matters with third parties. According to Eskom’s website, Rakau was its divisional executive for security in the Office of the Chief Executive. The resignation of Rakau was sudden. Late last week he was still briefing the media with comments about how infrastructure theft was affecting the power utility. Rakau was appointed on October 22, 2015 under then-group chief executive Brian Molefe to the position of divisional executive for security at Eskom. Eskom said at the time that Rakau had previously served as chief of security at Transnet Freight Rail, and as senior staff officer in the office of the Chief of the South African National Defence Force. — Fin24
