The optics of this year’s Brics (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) summit, with its focus on the “C”, makes it easy to forget about the other members. The combination of China’s President Xi Jinping’s visits to Senegal and Rwanda, his meeting with President Cyril Ramaphosa (with an investment pledge of about $14.7-billion) and South Africa’s focus on pulling the rest of Africa into the Brics orbit creates the impression that the gathering is functioning as a stepping stone to September’s Forum on China-Africa Co-operation (FOCAC) summit in Beijing. South Africa’s dual role as host of the Brics and co-chair (with China) of this year’s FOCAC strengthens the impression that Brics and China-Africa relations are flowing together in complicated ways. One big reason for this overlap is that China has been active in emphasising the China-Africa narrative and broader co-operation.
