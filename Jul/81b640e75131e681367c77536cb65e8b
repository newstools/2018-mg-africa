The Johannesburg High Court ruled in favour of Cape Town football club Ajax’s reinstatement in the Absa Premiership and Premier Soccer League (PSL). Monday’s ruling by Judge Denise Fisher means Ajax have effectively been restored to 15th position in the Absa Premiership, with Platinum Stars dropping to 16th. Tendai Ndoro’s eligibility remains undetermined, however, and has been sent to the Fifa Players’ Status Committee for a final ruling. The club’s standing was put in jeopardy after it was found guilty of illegally fielding Ndoro.
Ndoro allegedly violated the rule of playing for more than two teams in one season by also playing for Orlando Pirates and Al Faisaly. Platinum Stars, Polokwane City and SuperSport United protested Ndoro’s eligibility and the PSL subsequently charged Ajax.

The Mother City team was docked nine points which plummeted them to 16th and automatic relegation. It remains to be seen what course of action the PSL may decide to take. It’s likely the relegation play-offs will have to be replayed or even that the league will expand to 18 teams next season. Last week, Ikamva announced that Ndoro’s contract with the club would not be renewed. Ajax planned to take their plea for reinstatement in the PSL to the Court of Arbitration of Sport, should they have lost in the high court.
