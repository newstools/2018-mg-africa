In 1985, South African music legend Ray Phiri collaborated with a number of other South African artists on Paul Simon’s legendary Graceland album. From the beginning, the recording of the album was mired in controversy. But, it was not until almost 30 years later that Ray Phiri revealed he felt had been cheated of his royalties and composer rights by Paul Simon and that there was bad blood between them. In this Sound Africa podcast Lungile Sojini revisits the story of the Graceland album.
He tries to find out, what exactly Ray Phiri was unhappy about and who was responsible for the conflict.
