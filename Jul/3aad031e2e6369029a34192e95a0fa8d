The ANC’s KwaZulu-Natal provincial conference will go ahead tonight after the high court in Pietermaritzburg struck an application to interdict the elective meeting off the roll. Earlier on Thursday, a group of ANC members from the Lower South Coast and Moses Mabhida regions had gone to court to try and stop the conference from taking place. The group — Ntando Khenisa, Mhlengi Zuma, Colin Mlanzi, Malusi Tsaulwayo and Thembinkosi Dwayisa — had claimed the process leading to conference was flawed. The court dismissed the application with costs. ANC officials are busy concluding the registration process and delegates are starting to trickle into the venue. In June, branches from four regions successfully interdicted the conference from going ahead.
However, they withdrew their action after their complaints were resolved by the ANC national dispute resolution committee. Last September the same court set aside the result of the November 2015 elective conference. ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe confirmed the conference would go ahead. The judgement come a day after the South Gauteng High Court dismissed an application by branches from the ANC Sedibeng reason lost a court bid to halt the Gauteng provincial conference, which kicks off on Friday.
