The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has rejected representations by lawyers for French arms dealer Thint — co-accused in former president Jacob Zuma’s corruption case — that the case against it be withdrawn. NPA spokesperson Luvuyo Mfaku confirmed on Wednesday morning that the case against Thint — formerly known as Thales — for allegedly paying a R500 000 bribe to Zuma for protection from investigations into the 1996 arms deal, would continue. Thales allegedly made the payment through Zuma’s former financial advisor Schabir Shaik, who was jailed for his corrupt relationship with Zuma, to whom he also paid R1.4-million in unlawful payments. Mfaku said the NPA had written to Thint informing the company that its written representation requesting a review of the decision to charge the company had failed. “Thint had made written representation to the NPA requesting a review of decision to pursue the charges, The request was rejected,” he said. Mfaku said there had not been a decision to add any charges to the indictment, which contains 16 charges of fraud and corruption against Zuma, “at this stage.”
