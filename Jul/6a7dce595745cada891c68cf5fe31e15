This Sound Africa podcast is a story of a man and his mother. While it is set in the transition years between the old and the new South Africa, the story is a deeply personal narrative of how the past never goes away, but always travels with us.
It is a story of grief and how a son tries to escape his own. Sound Africa is supported by the Open Society Foundationâ€™s Project for Independent Journalism and Hindenburg Systems. Every two weeks another episode will be released here and on Soundafrica.org.
