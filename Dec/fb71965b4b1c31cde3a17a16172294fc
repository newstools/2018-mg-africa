President Cyril Ramaphosa has welcomed the court ruling dismissing a bid by former South Africa Revenue Service (Sars) commissioner Tom Moyane to have his dismissal overturned, saying he will appoint a new commissioner soon. Ramaphosa said in a statement that the judgment was “a step towards stabilising Sars” and that he would “soon initiate the process to appoint a new Sars commissioner”. Ramaphosa fired Moyane in November, following the recommendation of an interim report by the Nugent Commission of Inquiry, which was set to probe issues of tax administration and governance at Sars Moyane had gone to court to challenge the jurisdiction of the report, and sought to interdict the appointment of a new Sars commissioner and further prevent the Nugent Commission of Inquiry from submitting its final report. Nugent is expected to submit his final report to Ramaphosa by the end of the week. “In line with the recommendations of the Nugent Commission, the President will soon initiate the process to appoint a new Sars commissioner,” said a statement from the presidency. Mark Kingon has been acting as interim Sars commissioner since Moyane’s suspension in March, after Ramaphosa said he had lost confidence in Moyane’s ability to lead Sars. The court also dismissed Moyane’s submission to seek personal costs against Ramaphosa. His legal team said after the judgement that they would study the case and possibly go back to court.
