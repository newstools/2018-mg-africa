On December 21, I will be turning 59. I was employed, but the company was not doing well.
I started baking cookies at home and sold them at work when we were in a process of retrenchments. <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div>My colleagues used to laugh at me but I didn’t care. Then one day my younger sister, a teacher from Lenasia, suggested that instead of doing nothing — after my kota business failed — I should start transporting her two kids and three kids of a friend. I drive an Uno. I would take them to school in the morning and fetch them in the afternoon. The business grew. I took kids from grades R, 1, 2 and 3 but when they got to grade 4, it would get challenging. Because of their height and size, I would find alternative transport for them. The other challenge was paying a monthly fee to the transport association operating in schools. I was not making much money then, so I decided to stop. I then decided to only transport kids from crèches around. At first I was worried of how I was going to make it financially. But, by the grace of God, I saw the number of kids increasing. I collect kids at six in the morning for those parents who leave for work and then a second load at 8am. In the afternoon I still take two loads. I remember telling my sister-in-law that I have 20 kids. She was shocked. And she said that they are more than the ones that a Kombi takes. Then it hit me, that God has turned my Uno into a Kombi. — Mapule Thene (58), as told to Oupa Nkosi
