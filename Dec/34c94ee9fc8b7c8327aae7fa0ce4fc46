“Physics was invented and built by men,” said Alessandro Strumia, a senior Italian scientist, in a seminar in September on gender issues in physics at Cern, the European nuclear research centre in Geneva. The reason, he said, for the discrepancy in the numbers of men and women in the field is that women are innately less capable than men. He then suggested that male scientists are being discriminated against in order to give opportunities to women. More than 4 000 scientists from around the globe have signed a statement pointing out the scientific and moral problems with Strumia’s remarks. “Physics and science are part of the shared inheritance of all people, as much as art, music and literature, and we should strive to ensure that everyone has a fair opportunity to become a scientist,” reads the statement.
