After a run of poor results, Kaizer Chiefs have parted ways with manager Giovanni Solinas after just five months in charge. The news was confirmed on Chiefs’ Twitter account. Solinas was appointed manager of the South African club in July this year but with the Amakhosi currently in seventh place on the Absa Premiership log with just four wins in 14 games, the club decided to take action. At present, there is no news on who will replace the Italian in the Chiefs hot seat.
