The Airports Company South Africa (Acsa) is taking advantage of the opportunities that Africa’s growing economies offer as revenue from its local operations declines. Acsa’s latest achievement is the delivery of the R3.7-billion terminal at Ghana’s Kotoka International Airport (KIA), which will be able to accommodate up to five million passengers a year. The airport is big enough for aircraft the size of an Airbus A380 to land. The facility has the latest in technology, including a baggage-handling system that processes up to 3 000 bags an hour and automated boarding gates, which open after confirming the traveller’s details on the bar code on their boarding pass. It also has three business lounges, a large commercial and retail space and six boarding bridges. This article is only available to Mail & Guardian subscribers at present.
