RMB Global Markets Research head Nema Ramkhelawan-Bhana expected inflation figures to be unchanged at 5.1%, due to “relatively stable” fuel prices.

On a month-on-month basis, November inflation increased by 0.2%. The main contributors to monthly inflation were food and non-alcoholic beverages, up 0.4% and transport up 0.6%.
