Water-shedding is inevitable because the business case for new water infrastructure doesn’t add up. Your house gets 6 00 litres of free water each month. That’s the equivalent of six fully laden bakkies delivering water to your home each month. With an average national use of nearly 300 litres of water a person a day, that’s 9 000 litres each a month (or nine bakkies loaded with water). In Gauteng, those bakkies have to travel nearly 500km from Lesotho, where one end of the province’s water catchment starts. A house might pay R200 for what it uses beyond the free allowance.
