Sick and tired of living in a recession? Well, Statistics SA has good news for you. The economy grew by 2.2% in the third quarter this year, meaning that the economy is growing and the country is no longer in a recession. The 2.2% growth in the gross domestic product (GDP) in the third quarter — July to September — equates to an annualised 1.1% improvement from a year ago.
The GDP measures the total output of the economy. The rand strengthened after Stats SA released the results on Tuesday, with economist Lukman Otunuga of FXTM said: “a vulnerable dollar is poised to complement the rand’s gains”. The main growth driver is the manufacturing industry which expanded by 7.5% in the third quarter from an increase in basic iron and steel, metal products, machinery and motor vehicles. <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div> Stats SA lumps the following under manufacturing: iron and steel, metal products and machinery, wood, paper and publishing; petroleum, chemical products, rubber and plastic products; and motor vehicles, parts and accessories and other transport equipment. Manufacturing was followed by agriculture where output increased by 6.5%. The transport, storage and communication sector was up by 5.7% while finance, real estate and business services increased by 2.3%, also in the third quarter. The primary industry sector still lags, the mining industry decreasing by 8.8%, construction by 2.7% and electricity, gas and water by 0.9%. The positive growth recorded in the third quarter follows two quarters of negative growth in the first (-2.6) and second (-0.7%) quarters this year. Household final consumption expenditure increased by 1.6% in the third quarter which contributed 1.0% to total growth, Stats SA said. However, independent consultancy Capital Economics says in a note that the growth trajectory will probably slow down in the final quarter of the year due to “weaker agricultural growth and the imposition of power cuts.”
