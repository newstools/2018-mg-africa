Patricia de Lille will resign from her position as mayor of Cape Town effective from October 31 after protracted battles with the Democratic Alliance (DA). Three sources inside the party have confirmed to the Mail & Guardian that De Lille has tendered her resignation. The mayor will remain a member of the DA, but will no longer face the disciplinary hearing that was expected to begin this week. In an earlier agreement in July, De Lille and the DA had agreed the hearing would be open to the media. A source close to De Lille confirmed the resignation to the M&G, saying that the party had “withdrawn the charges” against her because they “feared an open disciplinary committee”. Senior leaders in the DA’s Cape Town caucus were called to a meeting by party leader Mmusi Maimane who informed them at 6pm on Saturday night that De Lille had tendered her resignation. The leaders were allegedly told it was De Lille herself who asked to resign because she does not want to submit herself to the disciplinary committee. The M&G understands De Lille’s new agreement with the party will see the DA also apologise for the saga and admit that it did not follow due process, according to the source close to her. These terms are believed to have led to her resignation. The DA caucus is now meeting with the senior leadership where they have been informed about the resignation. De Lille and Maimane will officially announce the resignation at 12pm. This is a developing story and will be updated as more details emerge.
