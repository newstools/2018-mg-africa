Senegalese filmmaker and ethnographer Safi Faye is most noted for centering her work on the experiences of the everyday. Born of the Serer people, a farming community that lives largely apart from some of the country’s larger cultural groups, Faye has a vested interest in telling stories that detail the lives of people cameras often refuse to see. Faye’s films, specifically Kaddu Beykat (The Voice of the Peasant) (1975) and Fad’jal (1979), take a close look at the daily lives of villagers, placing their experiences in the context of the larger political and social conversations of the time.
