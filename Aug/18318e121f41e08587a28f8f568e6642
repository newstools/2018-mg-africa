How much would a prospective driver be asked to pay to get a driver’s licence? It depends on the municipality, Corruption Watch reports. The driver could pay between R2 500 and R3 500 to get their license — over and above the driving instructor’s fee. Corruption Watch’s newly released Analysis of Corruption Trends report looks at the trends in the 2 469 corruption cases that is has received since January 2018. The non-profit organisation was launched in January 2012 to provide a platform for reporting and investigating corruption. To date, it has received over 23 000 reports of corruption. This is a summary breakdown of the reports received: Although the number of reported incidents of corruption may be disheartening, the report noted that it was encouraging that people “cared enough” to report irregularities. “We need to see corruption for what it truly is — a malignancy, a devious act of immorality that harms all over a long period, and a problem that we most certainly can overcome just as long as we remain vigilant and firm in our efforts to encourage and protect those willing to blow the whistle on corruption,” the report noted.
