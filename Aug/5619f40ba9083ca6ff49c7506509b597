The ANC’s national executive committee (NEC) has confirmed it has disbanded its provincial executive committee in the North West province following a special meeting on Thursday evening. ANC secretary general Ace Magashule confirmed reports the PEC had been dissolved in a press conference on Friday morning. The party has since established a provincial task team led by Job Mokgoro, who took over the reigns as premier of the province when Supra Mahumapelo resigned in May. “We agreed to set up an inclusive — and I must emphasise this one — an inclusive provincial task team that will be seized with the task of uniting the organisation and positioning it as an effective leader of society,” Magashule said on Friday. The disbandment of the PEC means that Mahumapelo has now been removed as PEC chairperson in the North West. But Magashule said the controversial former North West leader was involved in the discussions that led to his removal on Thursday night. “In the traditions of the ANC and as a disciplined member of the movement, the former chair of North West Supra Mahumapelo took part in the discussions and fully accepted the outcome,” Magashule said. The focus of the provincial task team would be to unite the North West ANC which has unravelled into a divided structure of the party. Magashule said the task team would work with all stakeholders — including the ANC’s alliance partners — to re-establish leadership and unity. A list of individuals who will be included in the task team will be finalised after the party’s national working committee holds a special meeting to decide on who will be included in the team.
