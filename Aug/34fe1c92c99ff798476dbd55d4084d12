The shooting of a teenage boy allegedly by a foreign store owner has sparked violence in Soweto as tensions between locals and foreign nationals in the area came to a boil on Wednesday. Media reports have said that a second person has died in the unrest, but this is as yet unconfirmed by the Mail & Guardian. According to media reports, the store owner opened fire on people allegedly breaking into his business earlier on Wednesday, killing the teenager in the process. Media reports said that the community members made their way into the store to remove stock amid rampant claims of foreign store owners selling expired foods and items with fake labels on them. The community responded to the death by looting the shop and assaulting the owners. Police spokesperson Mpande Khoza told EWN: “We’ve opened a case of murder. No one has been arrested so far. The situation is very tense, and the police are in the area trying to monitor the situation.” Police are currently patrolling the area to quell the violence and the looting of spaza shops. This is a developing story and will be updated as more details emerge
