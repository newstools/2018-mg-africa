In one of the most bizarre scenes to happen on a soccer pitch, Orlando Pirates striker Thamsanqa Gabuza threw his jersey at his own booing fans before storming off the pitch. Orlando Pirates ran out 2-1 victors over newly-promoted Black Leopards in an Absa Premiership clash at the New Peter Mokaba Stadium on Tuesday night. It all started with Gabuza missing a slew of chances early in the first half leading to disgruntled Pirates fans to jeer their own player while calling for him to be substituted. Gabuza was then sent clear down the left flank and his low cross came off Black Leopards defender Ndou’s shin to fly past his own goalkeeper in the 34th minute. The goal led to bizarre scenes as Gabuza, in celebration, angrily flung his shirt into the crowd before walking down the tunnel. The 31-year-old angrily motioned to fans, copying their calls for a substitution motion, before disappearing into the changing room. The Soweto giants played the remaining 10 minutes of the half with just 10 men, while Gabuza also did not appear for the start of the second half. He eventually made his way back to the bench aided by coaching staff with ice strapped to his upper leg to feign an apparent “knee injury”. The referee immediately stopped play and marched over to the player before issuing two yellow cards for his actions - one for removing his jersey and for leaving the field of play.
