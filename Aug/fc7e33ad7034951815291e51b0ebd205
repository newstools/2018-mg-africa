The SABC has confirmed it will once again broadcast local soccer matches on radio after the opening weekend of the Absa Premiership saw fans having no way of following their favourite teams other than on television. Communications minister Nomvula Mokonyane and sport and recreation minister, Tokozile Xasa, convened a meeting on Monday with the SABC board following an outcry from the public. At the meeting the SABC briefed both ministers in order to provide an in-depth understanding of the events that led to the initial decision, the liquidity issues affecting the company and the acquisition of sport rights in general. The ministers then met with representatives of the Premier Soccer League — including Irvin Khoza and Kaizer Motaung as well as chief executive Mato Madlala — where it was unanimously agreed that all parties will immediately commence a process to finalise all pertinent issues relating to the agreements that govern the relationship between them. In the interim, both the SABC and PSL agreed that all soccer matches will be broadcast on the SABC radio platforms as per the fixtures list for the 2018/19 season. Both Minister Mokonyane and Xasa apologised to the soccer loving public that coverage of PSL games was interrupted over the weekend. — Sport24
