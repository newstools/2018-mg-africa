Brighton & Hove Albion have confirmed that South African attacker  Percy Tau has officially joined Belgian second division side Royale Union Saint-Gilloise on loan. The 24-year-old joined Albion last month from Mamelodi Sundowns for an undisclosed fee, with the immediate plan for him to be loaned out by the club. Brighton owner Tony Bloom is also a majority shareholder of Royale Union Saint-Gilloise with the apparent aim of Tau’s loan to help his new side to gain promotion to the Belgian top-flight. “Percy is a talent we have brought to the club for the future, and this loan allows him to play regular senior football here in Europe,” the club said. “It is a significant investment for us, and we will be closely watching his progress with Union and monitoring his development over the season.” Brighton previously confirmed that the 24-year-old striker would be sent out on loan ahead of the new season after agreeing a four-year deal. “Going out on loan is always good to help a player develop and get better. It’s new for me to be in Europe, and I’ll get to work on myself and a few things that I need to improve. “I’m hoping to get a better understanding of the game from playing there.
It’s a different approach to what we’re used to in South Africa. It’s exciting football.” The striker was named the Absa Premiership Player and Player’s Player of the Year in 2017/18 and scored 13 goals for Mamelodi Sundowns, as they lifted the league title. — Sport24
