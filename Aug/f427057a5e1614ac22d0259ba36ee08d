MultiChoice has announced Newzroom Afrika as the new black-owned 24-hour news channel on satellite service DStv’s bouquet, after the group decided not to renew its contract with Afro Worldview. Newzroom Afrika was created by Eclipse TV’s Thokozani Nkosi and Rapid Innovation’s Thabile Ngwato. MultiChoice SA CEO Calvo Mawela made the announcement saying, “Today marks the birth of an exciting new and independent media voice in South Africa.” “We set out to find a quality new, black-owned, independent news channel to expand the diversity of SA news and enrich our democracy — we’re excited by the outcome,” Mawela added. Afro Worldview was known as ANN7 when it was owned by the Gupta family’s Infinity Media. ANN7 launched in August 2013. In late January, MultiChoice announced that the news channel’s contract will not be renewed when it lapses in August 2018. More than 60 companies launched bids for the 24-hour television slot, including Afro Worldview, the operator said. In mid-July, Manyi submitted court papers seeking the liquidation of Afro Voice, formerly known as The New Age. Staff at the Afro Worldview, meanwhile, were informed not to report for work from August 21. An employee said earlier in the month that Afro Worldview management were awaiting the outcome of the bidding process. — Fin24
