Ever since taking up literature studies at the University of Witwatersrand in the late 1990s, author Nthikeng Mohlele has read JM Coetzee’s Life and Times of Michael K more than 30 times, a copy of which was handed to him by poet and novelist Phaswane Mpe. It is one of several books Mohlele has reread, including Knut Hamsun’s Hunger and Dambudzo Marechera’s Black Sunlight. A Booker prize-winner in 1983, Life and Times of Michael K was so uniquely resonant for Mohlele that he chose to adapt it by recasting the protagonist into a contemporary setting, which takes into account the time that has elapsed between the two projects and what Mohlele relates to as the evolved cultural landscape. “I wanted to humanise the character, give him immediacy,” says Mohlele.
