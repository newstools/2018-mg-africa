A prison inmate has reported three Hawks officials for allegedly trying to strong-arm him into implicating the head of the National Prosecuting Authority in South Gauteng, Andrew Chauke, of accepting a bribe. The allegation comes after Chauke decided to prosecute the North West deputy commissioner, Major General Ntebo Mabula, and nine other members of the Organised Crime Unit for the alleged torture of two suspects. Chauke was also interviewed for the post of national director of public prosecutions on Thursday evening.
