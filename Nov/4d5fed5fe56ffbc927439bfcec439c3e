Thursday. The Durban morning has a battered but tentatively hopeful feel to it. It’s as if the city has been taking cover for the past few days, lying low to ride out the heavy weather, and is emerging, a little stunned, from its shelter. The sun is showing its face for the first time in nearly a week, ending, hopefully, the deep ache in the bones that comes with extended periods of wet weather these days. The wind has finally dropped, but the ocean is out for the next few days until the water clears. It’s the 101st anniversary of the rather strangely named October Revolution in Russia — it took place in November — so maybe the tentative and hopeful thing about the morning is coming from that. I’ve never been much of a fan of dead white men, apart from Joe Strummer from The Clash, but Vladimir Lenin is all right in my book. Lenin and his comrades must have been stoked this time a century and a year ago. This article is only available to Mail & Guardian subscribers at present. Please login or consider subscribing.
