In the middle of Manelis’s album Aircuts, there is a snippet of deceased Durban emcee XO rapping a verse. He is transposed on to the proceedings from an old mixtape put together by Measurement, producer for Touch Is a Move. The 45-second snippet embodies the street-level cool of XO, who was murdered in 2004, immortalising him with the electricity of Biggie Smalls’s now famed Fulton Street freestyle. If you listen closely, you can hear Manelis’s incredulous laugh at the genius of XO, whom he had accompanied to the recording session at which the rhyme was laid down. “In terms of creative writing back in the day, XO represents this idea of a very thugged-out persona but with, like, a really intellectual ability to express himself and his viewpoint with grammatical diversity,” says Manelis.
