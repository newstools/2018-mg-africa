President Cyril Ramaphosa has granted the Nugent Commission of Inquiry a two-week extension to file its final report on the state of tax administration and governance at the South African Revenue Service. The commission, which was established in May and is chaired by retired judge Robert Nugent, was scheduled to deliver its final report by Friday. Presidency spokesperson Khusela Diko said on Tuesday that the extension has been granted until December 14. The commission handed over an interim report in October, which recommended that suspended Sars commissioner Tom Moyane be fired, and a successor appointed to “arrest the ongoing loss of revenue and eroding tax compliance and to set Sars on a firm course of recovery”. Ramaphosa acted on the recommendations and fired Moyane. The tax agency’s former boss then approached the Constitutional Court directly, arguing that the commission did not have the jurisdiction to advise he be removed. But the apex court dismissed his application, stating that grounds for exclusive jurisdiction had not been established and a basis had not been laid for direct access, as the court believed Moyane had other avenues available. Moyane, meanwhile, is set to press ahead with another urgent court application on December 4 and 5 in which he is expected to ask the high court in Pretoria to order that he be reinstated and interdict a successor from being appointed. He will also ask the court to rule that none of the remaining recommendations by the Nugent Commission be implemented. — Fin 24
