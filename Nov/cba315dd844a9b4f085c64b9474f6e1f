Axed South African Revenue Service (Sars) commissioner Tom Moyane appear before the commission of inquiry into state capture should his lawyer’s application to cross-examine Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan succeed. Gordhan is presently testifying before Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo. Moyane’s lawyer, Eric Mabuza, said they had informed the commission on Monday of their intention to apply for permission to cross-examine Gordhan. The formal application would be lodged “soon”. Gordhon’s leaked affidivat to the commission indicates that he is likely to implicate Moyane in his testimony. Mabuza said on Wednesday that if someone applies to cross-examine a witness at the commission, they must also be prepared to take the stand and give their own version of events. He said if his application is successful, Moyane will be prepared to take the stand. Gordhan, who was previously served as finance minister twice before being axed by former president Jacob Zuma, has been on the stand since Monday. He was reappointed to Cabinet by President Cyril Ramaphosa in February. During his first two days of testimony, Gordhan has testified about preferred appointments at government entities, mysterious foreign deals at local parastatals, and Zuma’s determination to procure nuclear power, among other things. He has also told the commission that Zuma had his heart set on installing Moyane as SARS commissioner having shown as described by Gordhan: an ‘extraordinary interest’. A separate inquiry into the administration of Sars, the Nugent commission, recommended previously in its interim report to Ramaphosa that Moyane be sacked after damning testimony before the commission. Ramaphosa acted on this advice and fired Moyane in early November. Moyane is presently challenging his dismissal through the courts. — News24
