Duduzane Zuma was in attendance at the commission of inquiry into state capture on Wednesday to raise a grievance about not being notified of the postponement of the cross-examination of former deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas. Zuma’s counsel said they were prepared to cross-examine Jonas only to find out on Tuesday that the cross-examination was postponed to November 26 which is an inconvenience because their client had travelled from overseas, leaving his expectant wife to make an appearance. Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo — who is chairing the commission — instructed the commission’s legal team to ensure that all relevant parties are informed before applications are heard. He added that Zuma, Jonas and the commission’s legal teams must meet and decide on a date for cross-examination that is most suitable for all of them.
The November 26 date will remain until further notice, Zondo said. In September, Zuma’s lawyers successfully applied for the right to cross-examine Jonas about the testimony he gave implicated the former president’s son as having coordinated a clandestine meeting between Jonas and Ajay Gupta in 2015. At the meeting Jonas was allegedly offered the position of finance minister as well as a R600-million bribe in return for his cooperation in supporting the business interests of the politically connected Gupta family. Businessperson Mzwanele Manyi was also at the commission to testify and respond to allegations made against him by acting government communication and information systems (GCIS) head Phumla Williams about his tenure at GCIS and changes he made to the media buying processes of the communication service. Manyi is scheduled to testify on November 23 as per the commission’s schedule. He received correspondence saying there is an opening for him to appear on Wednesday to respond to certain allegations but the commission’s legal team said it as yet, not prepared to hear his testimony.
