Come May next year, Ignatius Sehoole will succeed Nhlamulo Dlomu as chief executive of beleaguered auditing firm KPMG. Sehoole has a mammoth task ahead of him, with the expectation that he will “restore trust in KPMG,” a press statement released on Wednesday stated. KPMG’s executive chair Professor Wiseman Nkuhlu said the challenges facing KPMG and the auditing profession, in general, led the board “to appoint an external candidate to the firm with strong industry credentials”. “In Ignatius, I am pleased we have found a leader equal to the task,” Nkuhlu said. “We worked closely together during our time at SAICA and this gives me great confidence that he has both the character and experience to succeed in this role.
His strong record in promoting black chartered accountants will also be a key asset in promoting transformation at KPMG,” he added. Sehoole served as the executive president of the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants (SAICA) between 2000 and 2009. Commenting on his appointment, Sehoole said, “My priority at KPMG will be to continue to restore client confidence and again make KPMG a firm where the best people wish to work. I look forward to the opportunity to accelerate this rehabilitation phase.” Sehoole’s predecessor will be taking on a position in the global framework of KPMG, where she will focus on “organisational culture change and ethical leadership”. According to the statement, Nkuhlu will serve as executive chairperson until May 1 2019, when Nkuhlu will revert to a non-executive chairman role. KPMG Media Statement by Mail and Guardian on Scribd
