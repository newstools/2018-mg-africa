A group of women from Colenso’s Inkanyezi township near Ladysmith were held in ­custody without bail for more than two months after a peaceful service delivery protest. They were released this week after pleading guilty to public violence charges. But according to family members, the 16 women pleaded guilty in a desperate bid to get out of prison and back to their families after they were repeatedly denied bail. The women, who are to appear in the regional court in Estcourt for ­sentencing on November 16, are ­considering their legal options, ­family members said. Sibongile Mahlaba (46) and 15 other women, aged between 19 and 54, were arrested for blocking the R103 between Colenso and Ladysmith on August 30.
