Springbok skipper Siya Kolisi has escaped sanction for what appears to be a blatant headbutt against Scotland at Murrayfield on Saturday. In the 30th minute of the clash, Kolisi, while held on the ground by Scottish midfielder Peter Horne, used the back of his head to strike his opponent. “I really haven’t seen it,” said Springbok coach Rassie Erasmus. “I can’t comment on something I didn’t see myself, but I know the person and the man he is, so it would surprise me. “I’m pretty sure the citing commissioner will do his job there. Whatever it is - if it’s serious and Siya’s in the wrong, then what comes our way we have to accept.
But I haven’t seen the incident so I can’t really comment.” According to World Rugby’s citing policy, the citing commissioner has 24 hours after the final whistle in which to cite any incidents — which would’ve been around 9pm on Sunday. Erasmus was, however, prepared to give his views on the Willie le Roux yellow card for a deliberate knock-on early in the second half. In their first match on their end of year tour against England, the Springboks were incensed that flyhalf Owen Farrell escaped a World Rugby sanction for a shoulder charge in extra-time. The Springboks went as far as to practice shoulder-charge tackles in the week after the match. — Sport24
