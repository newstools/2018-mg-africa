Eskom has suspended Abram Masango — its group executive for capital — pending an investigation into Masango’s alleged actions of impropriety relating to coal-powered Kusile power station project in Mpumalanga. This is not Masango’s first suspension. In 2017, he was the subject of a disciplinary hearing over allegations of failing to do proper risk and governance processes relating to Kusile power station and failing to obtain legal advice on the project in contravention of Eskom’s delegation on authority. In April this year, he was cleared of all charges. “Whilst we recognise his rights to be presumed innocent, however, given the serious allegations made against him, and seniority of his position in Eskom, Eskom management took a decision to place him on suspension pending the outcome of the investigation,” the statement reads. The Eskom board said it is “committed to investigating all allegations of impropriety involving Eskom”.
