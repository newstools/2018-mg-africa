A high court action by two farm tenants in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands to force municipalities to provide them with water and sanitation is likely to benefit more than 42 000 people in the Umgungundlovu district municipality alone. The application, brought by Zabalaza Mshengu and Thabisile Ntombifuthi Ngema in the high court in Pietermaritzburg, aims to compel Umgungundlovu and the Msunduzi and uMshwathi local municipalities to develop a “reason-able plan” to provide them with water and sanitation. The Association for Rural Advancement (Afra) is a co-applicant in the case, which was brought by the Legal Resources Centre (LRC), on behalf of Ngema and Mshengu. The matter will be argued this Friday (November 2). The two lived with their families on farms in the district and have been battling for years to get the municipalities to provide them with water, toilets and refuse removal.
