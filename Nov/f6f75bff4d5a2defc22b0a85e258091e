Izinduna from Babanango in northern KwaZulu-Natal, whose salaries were frozen by the Zululand House of Traditional Leaders last year, have gone to court to have their payments reinstated. The salaries of the nine izinduna from the Nobamba tribal authority were suspended because of a boundary dispute in which izinduna from the uSuthu tribal authority have claimed authority over their area. The House has stated they are part of a broader group of izinduna affected by boundary disputes following the decisions of a provincial government audit. The House, the provincial co-operative governance and traditional affairs department and Premier Willies Mchunu are opposing the application. Phiwokuhle Guma, the director of the House, said the provincial government had declared a dispute with the presidency over the decision to pay izinduna, taken by former president Jacob Zuma in 2015.
