Government is keeping the petrol price unchanged. However there will be price increases for other fuels. The department of energy (DOE) released the fuel price changes for November on Monday. In the statement, the DOE indicated there would be no change to both grades of petrol. Diesel (0.05% sulphur) will increase 47.92 c/l, while diesel (0.005% sulphur) will increase 50.92 c/l. Illuminating paraffin (wholesale) will increase 28 c/l increase and single maximum national retail price for illuminating paraffin will increase 37 c/l. Maximum LP Gas retail price will increase 61.00 c/kg. Last week, the Automobile Association (AA) estimated that there would be a drop in the petrol price, and increases in diesel and illuminating paraffin.
The AA attributed this to the exchange rate. The department set the adjustments based on the oil price and the rand exchange rate, which appreciated in the past month. Government has also implemented a Slate levy on petrol and diesel, worth 21.92c/l, which comes into effect November 7 2018, in order to improve the Slate account balance which is below its threshold. Last week Energy Minister Jeff Radebe told Parliament that his department’s research on the possibility of fixing a cap to the price of unleaded fuel may be concluded in January 2019. — News 24 Media Statement Fuel Prices for November 2018 by Mail and Guardian on Scribd
