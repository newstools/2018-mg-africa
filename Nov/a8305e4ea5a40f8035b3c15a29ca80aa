Banyana Banyana are into the final of the 2018 African Cup of Nations (AFCON) and have qualified for the FIFA World Cup thanks to their 2-0 win over Mali in a semi-final clash on Tuesday evening. A goal from Thembi Kgatlhane in the 31st minute gave South Africa a crucial lead in the match. It was Kgatlhane fifth goal in four games at the tournament. It’s all over! Mission accomplished! @Banyana_Banyana is going to the @FIFAWWC for the 1st time ever.  History in the making @SAFA_net @SAFA_net @SasolLeague @SasolSA — Banyana_Banyana (@Banyana_Banyana) November 27, 2018 The result was wrapped up in the 80th minute when Lebohang Ramalepe chipped the Mali keeper from 20 metres out. South Africa will now play Nigeria in the final of the tournament. They will be desperately hoping to win the AFCON trophy after finishing runners-up in 2000, 2008 and 2012.
