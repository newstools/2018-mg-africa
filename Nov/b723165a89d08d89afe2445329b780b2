Groundbreaking legislation, signed into law on Sunday, gives Kimi Makwetu, the auditor general (AG), new powers to act on corruption and the abuse of public money. The Public Audit Amendment Act only needs the president to announce a commencement date for it to come into force. The amendments are a global first, according to Pan-African Investment & Research chief executive Iraj Abedian. If successfully implemented, “both corrupt politicians and corrupt technocrats will no longer be able to hide behind the collective to get away with the abuse of public funds”. The Public Audit Act of 2004 gave the AG the independence to establish auditing functions, but the AG’s office did not have the power to enforce the implementation of its recommendations. Wasteful expenditure and irregular expenditure increased to R2.5-billion and R51-billion respectively in the 2017-2018 financial year, and they have increased steadily since 2014.
