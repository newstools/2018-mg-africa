Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan is expected to deliver his long-awaited testimony before the commission of inquiry into state capture, chaired by Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo. Gordhan is expected to detail how some of his own Cabinet colleagues allegedly resisted — and attacked — treasury for looking into suspected corruption. According to Gordhan, some government officials were trying to halt crucial legislation that would give the government more power to scrutinise the banking affairs of politicians and politically connected business people.
