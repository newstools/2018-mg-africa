Zimbabwe’s land and agricultural ministry is reportedly seeking $40-million to compensate former white farmers, with the government promising to pay half of the amount. According to NewsDay newspaper, speaking before the land portfolio committee last week, finance ministry director Peter Mudzamiri said they had received only $20-million from government despite asking for $40-million which would have enabled them to pay at least 50 former white farmers in the 2019 financial year. “We only got $20-million, but the $40-million that we bid for was just an estimate looking at how many farmers we are going to pay. Our focus here is that we are looking at paying 50 former farmers in 2019,” Mudzamiri was quoted as saying. This came a few months after Lands and Agriculture Minister Perrance Shiri said that Zimbabwean authorities wanted to address “injustices” committed during the land reform exercise. “Our government is firmly committed to a process of the need for corrective measures to deal with the consequences of past injustices,” Shiri was quoted as saying by the state-owned Sunday Mail newspaper. Starting in 2000, thousands of white Zimbabwean farmers were forced off farms by violent state-backed mobs or evicted in dubious legal judgements, supposedly to help black people marginalised under British colonial rule, according to reports. The farms, however, were often allocated to former president Robert Mugabe’s allies and fell into ruin, leaving tens of thousands of rural labourers out of work and sending the economy into a tailspin as food production crashed, the report said.
